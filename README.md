## 🧠 How It Works

- The dataset contains movies and their descriptions.
- The `TfidfVectorizer` converts descriptions into numerical vectors.
- The `NearestNeighbors` model finds the most similar descriptions to the selected movie.
- For each recommended title, the OMDb API provides a poster and plot.
- If the poster is not found, a placeholder is shown.
